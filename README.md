# TS_unique_objects
The function takes an array of objects as input and returns an array of unique objects based on their 'name' property. The object is kept with the lowest 'id' property among the duplicates. The code first creates an empty Map object to store unique items based on their 'name' property. It then uses the filter method to loop through each element of the input array. If the 'id' of the current element is greater than or equal to the 'id' of the existing element, it skips the current element and returns false. If the 'name' property of the current element does not exist in the itemMap, it adds the current element to the itemMap and returns true. Finally, the function returns an array of unique objects based on the itemMap, which contains only the objects with the lowest 'id' property among the duplicates.
